## env_encryption_tool_nodejs :copyright: Project Goals & Info

**Purpose**: the goal for this project is to encrypt .env files for a given Node.js application and store them in an encrypted state, then decrypt them at runtime using an OS-based environment variable and pass them to the application. This requires any potential/illicit attacker to breach the operating system's security and access its environment variables before any application-level environment variables can be compromised. 

*Disclaimer:* this project is stable and can be used in production environments, but SLA-based support won't be offered until we're at v1.0 and/or sponsored. :bowtie:

## Installation Instructions

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) or use nvm (Node version manager) to install Node.js [on Linux/MacOS](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) or [on Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) :earth_americas:
2. Clone/fork the env_encryption_tool_nodejs repo :zap:
3. Modify the encryption key in encryptConfig.js to your desired content :lock:
4. Run "node encryptConfig.js" in the same folder as your .env file - this outputs a env.enc file :confetti_ball:
5. Integrate the included decryptConfig.js file and its packages/imports into your Node.js project :star:
6. Set an OS-level environment variable named "DECRYPTION_KEY" ( :earth_americas: [for Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45502996/how-to-set-environment-variable-in-linux-permanently), :earth_africa: [for Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/windows-set-environment-variable), :earth_asia: [for MacOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65597552/how-exactly-to-set-up-and-use-environment-variables-on-a-mac)) to the same value you placed in encryptConfig.js. 
7. Copy the env.enc file to the same folder your Node.js application runs in and voila! You have encrypted environment variables provided to your application at runtime. :tada:
8. (optional) Install pm2 to manage and enable auto-start of your Node.js app: npm install pm2@latest -g (this is how the files in this project are configured). Then run "pm2 start ecosystem.config.js" to start the application. :sparkles:
